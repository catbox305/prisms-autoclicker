## Installation

Download the .zip from the assets section of the latest release.
> Make sure to download the .zip that matches your CPU architecture.

Next, unzip the application and place it in your applications folder.\
You will not be able to open it yet due to the file being quarantined. **The app is not damaged.**\
To fix this, run ```xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/`whoami`/Applications/"prism's autoclicker.app"``` in your command line/terminal.

Finally, go to settings, select "Privacy/Security", and give the app "Input Monitoring" and "Accessibility" permissions.
